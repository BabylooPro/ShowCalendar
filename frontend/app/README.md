# /APP FOLDER

This folder is dedicated to managing the application routes using Next.js routing system.
The structure is optimized to be simple and lightweight, without including heavy UI components.
This helps maintain a clear and efficient organization of the project.

## MAIN USAGE

-   **Next.js App Router**: This folder uses the integrated Next.js router to define and manage the different pages of the application.
-   **Lightweight Structure**: It is designed to primarily contain pages with few or no complex UI components. Lightweight UI components can be included if necessary.
-   **Consistency and Simplicity**: This folder promotes a consistent and simple file structure, making code navigation and maintenance easier.

## WHY THIS STRUCTURE?

Separating the routes into the /app folder allows for easy management of the application's different pages without overloading the overall structure with complex UI components.
This approach improves code readability and simplifies the development process.

# /SRC FOLDER

This folder is designed to store complex UI components, functional logic, and local data management.
These elements are then integrated into the /app folder to provide a modular and maintainable structure for the application.

## MAIN USAGE

-   **Complex UI Components**: This folder contains reusable and more complex UI components, such as forms, modals, etc.
-   **Functional Logic**: It stores the application functional logic, including custom hooks, state managers, and other utilities.
-   **Local Data Management**: This folder manages the application local data, such as user settings, themes, and other preferences.
-   **Modular Implementation**: The components and logic contained in this folder are intended to be used in the /app folder, allowing for a modular and scalable structure.

## WHY THIS STRUCTURE?

Separating the UI components and functional logic into the /src folder helps maintain clean and organized code.
This makes the development and maintenance of the application easier by making each module independent and reusable.

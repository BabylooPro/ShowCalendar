# Personal and Professional Availability Calendar

## About the Project
This open-source project aims to create a flexible and customizable availability calendar, designed to adapt to various needs. It offers connectivity with existing calendars such as those offered by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, facilitating the management of personal and professional appointments.

### Objective
The main objective is to develop an open-source solution for an availability calendar, intended to serve as a foundation for customized versions. This project will integrate unit and integration tests to ensure quality and reliability. It will allow clients to view your availability and make appointments through an intuitive web interface. This interface will be powered by a robust backend solution, based on a RESTful API, thus ensuring a smooth and efficient interaction between the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Language**: C# with .NET 8.
- **API**: Minimal API for lightness and efficiency.
- **Authentication**: Generic mechanisms, such as JWT.

### Frontend
- **Initialization with Vite.js**: For enhanced development efficiency.
- **Framework**: React.js or Next.js with TypeScript.
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API.
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design.

### Tests
- **Unit and Integration**: Xunit and Jest.

## Key Features
1. **Modularity and Customization**: Modular design for easy customization and extension of the calendar.
2. **Security and Privacy**: Implementation of measures to ensure data security.
3. **Documentation and Contribution**: Comprehensive documentation to facilitate installation, configuration, and contribution to the project.

## Usage Scenarios
- **Freelancers, Small Businesses, Educational Projects, Software Developers**: The calendar can be used to manage client appointments, plan internal meetings, as a teaching tool, or as a technological case study.

## Open-Source Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Setting up the development environment and creating the GitHub repository.
- **Phase 2**: Initial development of the frontend and backend, with a focus on modularity and customization.
- **Phase 3**: Writing documentation for users and contributors.
- **Phase 4**: Setting up continuous integration, conducting tests, and preparing for the community's first contributions.
- **Phase 5**: Continuous improvement and maintenance of the project.

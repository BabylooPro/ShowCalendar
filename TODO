Todo Backend:
  ☐ Test and validate connection between MySQL database and Backend solution.
  ☐ Optimize queries and manage transactions with database.
  ☐ Set up a Xunit testing environment.
  ☐ Write unit tests for models, services, and database connection.
  ☐ Write integration tests for API endpoints.
  ☐ Continue to strengthen API's security, including integrating SSL/TLS for data encryption.
  ☐ Perform penetration testing and security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
  ☐ Consider integrating more advanced authentication mechanisms like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  ☐ Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering mechanisms for endpoints that return collections of data.
  ☐ Document each endpoint with Swagger for easier understanding and testing of API.
  ☐ Conduct a code review to ensure consistency and adherence to best development practices.
  ☐ Optimize error handling and logging mechanisms to improve traceability and diagnostics.
  ☐ Evaluate and potentially integrate monitoring and alerting tools to monitor performance and health of API.
  ☐ Develop a database backup and restoration strategy.
  ☐ Develop a user session management strategy to enhance security and user experience.
  ☐ Integrate an advanced logging system for better traceability of actions and errors such as Serilog or NLog.
  ☐ Implement caching mechanisms to improve API performance.
  ☐ Conduct API performance analysis and optimize the code based on the results.
  ☐ Develop password recovery features (e.g., email-based password reset).
  ☐ Implement rate limiting mechanisms to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks.
  ☐ Set up separate deployment environments (development, testing, production).
  ☐ Ensure continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the software delivery process.
  ☐ Implement API version management to facilitate updates and backward compatibility.
  ☐ Evaluate the need to integrate external services (e.g., payment services, push notifications).
  ☐ Plan regular maintenance and dependency updates to ensure security and performance.
  ☐ Review and optimize the database structure for better efficiency and scalability.
  ☐ Add data export and import features for users.
  ☐ Establish incident response protocols to quickly and effectively handle security issues.

Todo Frontend (Draft):
  ☐ Install and configure Vite.js and Next.js.
  ☐ Set up TypeScript development environment.
  ☐ Configure build and transpilation tools (Webpack, Babel).
  ☐ Create UI mockups and prototypes (using tools like Figma).
  ☐ Develop UI components using Next.js and React.
  ☐ Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
  ☐ Configure routing with Next Router.
  ☐ Choose and implement state management (Redux, Context API).
  ☐ Set up API services to interact with backend.
  ☐ Handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with Axios or Fetch API.
  ☐ Implement client-side authentication and secure management of JWT tokens and user sessions.
  ☐ Ensure interface is responsive for different devices and optimized for different browsers.
  ☐ Conduct unit and integration tests for React components and user flow.
  ☐ Analyze and optimize application performance using tools like Lighthouse.


This task list is one among several for the "Show Calendar" project. It is intended to provide an overview of planned and current tasks.
It is important to note that, depending on the specific needs of the project and the emergence of new features, modifications or additions to this list may be necessary.
The complete and updated task list is managed by the project's lead developer and may vary based on the progress of the project and established priorities.
This draft aims to facilitate coordination and planning but should not be considered definitive or exhaustive.
